# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to OpenSIN-AI!

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-feature`
3. Make changes and test
4. Commit with conventional commits
5. Open a PR

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript
- Follow existing patterns
- Write tests for new features
- JSDoc on exported functions

## Boundary Rules

Before adding a feature or top-level claim, answer:

1. Is this specifically WhatsApp integration work?
2. Does another OpenSIN repo already own the canonical source of truth?

### Put it in `A2A-SIN-WhatsApp` if:
- it improves WhatsApp integration
- it improves this repo's A2A agent behavior

### Do NOT put it in `A2A-SIN-WhatsApp` if:
- it claims broader product, ops, or docs ownership
